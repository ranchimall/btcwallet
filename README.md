# BTC Wallet

BTC Wallet
It is a web-based bitcoin wallet that promotes self-custody by generating Bitcoin addresses and private keys locally on the user's device. If you are suspicious about internet monitoring, then open the URL, disconnect your computer from the internet, and then generate the Bitcoin address and private key.

Do not forget to copy and save the private key in a safe place. This BTC wallet doesn't give a seed phrase but directly the original private key, which makes it more secure for the users to take full custody of their bitcoins.

*note: seed phrases are English words and can be memorized by someone who looks at your screen. Private keys are random characters that hide inside asterisk signs that make it difficult for anyone to look at it and memorize it.

These are client-side scripts that can generate Bitcoin addresses, send Bitcoin transactions to the blockchain, and monitor Bitcoin data from the bitcoin blockchain

## Instructions to use
